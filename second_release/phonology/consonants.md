 - the `/f/` sound in speech can swap to a soft `/p/` or `/v/` depending on the accent or dialect of the speaker
 - A soft `/p/` sound can become `/f/`, but a hard `/f/` cannot become `/p/`.
 - The sounds `/s/~/z/` and `/k/~/g/` can be exchanged with each other because of the emphasis in the speech.
