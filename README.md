# Hello.

Welcome to my Github, I never thought anyone would come :3

### So, what is this?
A mini-project of mine, an artificial language, also known as conlang (constructed language).

### What is the purpose of this project?
for fun xD

### Why are many parts still empty?
Because I'm not used to it here either, you see, I've never used github and the transition to using github has been quite difficult for me because I have to code everything here.

### what if I want to help?
Sure, make a pull request, and give me your idea.
It's currently lacking in vocabulary, so it's still unusable.

### What if I have a question?
You can make a pull request or chat me privately.

I'm more than happy to answer your enthusiastic questions ^^
